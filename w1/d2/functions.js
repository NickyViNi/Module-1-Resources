  Functions

  What is a function is?
    * A block of code that you can call and use over and over
    * Writing a function a is known as a function declaration or function definition
    * create reusable logic - do not have to repeat the same lines of code
    * Logic to be ran to output a value
    * A function evaluates to its return

  * Javascript reads top to bottom
  * Functions are not read till they are called/invoked

  So three things to remember about return statements are:
    1. Every function call evaluates to its return value
    2. Every function in javascript returns undefined unless a return is specified
    3. Once a return statement is encountered, the function will immediately stop and return the value, ignoring all the code below that line


  Function naming convention
    * camelCase -> functionTest
    * descriptive names
    * verb followed by a noun; CRUD: getInfo, deleteInfo, editInfo, createInfo
    * If the return value is a boolean, name could be checkBoolean

  Declaring/defining the function
  * Where parameters are used to represent the arguments passed
    function functionName(param1, param2) {

    }

  Calling/invoke the function
  * Where we pass our arguments to the function
    functionName(arg1, arg2)
  * When we call our function it will evaluate to its return
    functionName(arg1, arg2) => evaluates to return value of the function
    
    param1 = arg1
    param2 = arg2
