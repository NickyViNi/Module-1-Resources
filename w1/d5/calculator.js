Goal: build a function that utilizes helper function to solve some math problems

  - Given some input string and two nums, perform the correct operation and return the result
  - will likely if statements
  - upon meeting some condition, we wan to invoke the proper function and return its result

  Valid operations
    - addition
    - subtraction
    - multiplication
    - division

  Main Functions - calculator

  Understand the problem?
  - Input: 2 numbers and a operation - string => 10 and 2 multiplication
  - Output: a number -> 20
  * operation is multiplication
  * two nums 10 and 2
  * * use helper functions!
